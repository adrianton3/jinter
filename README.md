Jinter is a JavaScript interpreter written in CoffeeScript.
The project's purpose is purely educational.

Language constructs supported (thus far):

 + literals (numbers, strings, booleans and null)
 + the binary `+` operator for strings and numbers
 + the binary `-` operator
 + cast to boolean
 + if expressions and statements
 + while statements
 + for statements
 + vars, the `=` operator
 + objects
 + function expressions/declarations
 + the `new` operator and `this`
 + prototypes, prototype chains, the non-standard `__proto__`
